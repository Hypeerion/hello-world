# hello-world
my first git-hub repo
Cliff here.  I've just begun my coding journey after years of management, sales,
 customer service, finance, accounting, etc. - all the joys of running your own business.
 
 I'm looking forward to putting my data analytics skills, honed from years of practice in
 the advertising industry, with the new quantitative skills I've aquired through more formal
 data science and data analytics training.
